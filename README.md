# What is Public Info GT?

Public info gt is an open project to ease the access to the public information in Guatemala.

In 2008 the Guatemalan Congress approved the "Ley de Acceso a la Información Pública" that pretends to open access to the information to all the citizens, however, some state dependencies hide or obstruct the contact to the information offices.
Public Info GT is created as an information offices directory, with a simple and friendly interface for almost every user.
